- #### **Hard links and Soft links**
  - inode - An entry in the filesystem table about the location in the storage media
  - hard link points to the same inode (mem address)
  - soft link points to a hard link (or a file)
  - hard link must be on the same partition while soft link can point to a file at a totally different geographical location.
  - inode is metadata for the file . eg : size ,permissions,blocks etc.
  - ***$ ls -i <name>:*** To get inode no for a file.
  - ln and ln -s is used for creating hard links and soft links
  - inode is unique for every file : if there are multiple entries of inode then it means that they are all hard links
  - if there is a dir level1 with inode = 18874686 when you cd into that dir . will also have inode = 18874686 if i make a dir level2 inside level1 and then cd into level2 .. will have inode = 18874686 (no of hard links will increase by 1)
  - ***as number of sub directories increases the number of hardlinks also keeps increasing***
  - ***users cannot create hard links for directories*** (level1 to level2 and level2 to level1 will create a back and forth)
  <br>

***Permissions***
- Files and directories do not inherit the parent directory permissions 
- U G O ........user,group,other
7 rwx     
6 rw-
5 r-x 
4 r--
3 -wx
2 -w-
1 --x
  - only owners can change permissions of a file
  - Execute permission is required on a directory to cd into it (Even ls and tocuh to a dir will not work)
  - If you want to access a file, all its parent direcories should have x permission. This works even without r and w permissions if you know the path.
  - r and w permissions along with x is required to ls a directory or touch a file into a directory
  - Removing a file works only if it has write permission


***Linux Virtual Machine***
1. **ISO** 
     - Image of Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for x86_64 platform)
2. **Hypervisor** 
     - A Hypervisor creates and runs virtual machines
     - It allows running multiple operating systems while sharing hardware resources
   
***File System of Linux OS***
Filesystem Hirearchy Standard FHS 3.0 (June 03, 2015) (refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml)
/ is root directory and field separator or delimiter for sub-directories
. references the current directory (. is a special file in every directory)
.. references the parent directory (.. is a special file in every directory)
Path for traversal can be absolute or relative
- boot directory is where the kernel is located
- /usr/bin contains commands that we will use
- /bin - essential command binaries
- /boot static files of the bootloader
- /dev device files (different character in long format of file listing 'c' instead of 'l' or 'd'. 'c' indicates character file - means you can read from it character by character. if first character is 'b' they are block devices typically hdds - the block devices are made available as files.)
- /etc Host specific system configuration (.conf files)
- /lib Essential shared libraries and kernel modules (Typically contain files with version number at the end)
- /media mount points for removable devices
- /mnt mount points
- /opt add on application software packages
- /run Data relevant to running processes
- /sbin essential system binaries
- /srv data for services
- /tmp temporary files (normally flushed when system is rebooted)
- /usr secondary hierarchy
  - /usr/bin : user commands
  - /usr/lib : libraries
  - /usr/local : local hierarchy
  - /usr/sbin : non vital system binaries
  - /usr/share : architecture dependent data
  - /usr/include : header files included by c programs
  - /usr/src : source code
- /var variable data (/var/log contains logs for various services)
  - /var/cache : Application cache data
  - /var/lib : Variable state informtion
  - /var/local : variable data for /usr/local
  - /var/lock : lock files
  - /var/log : log files and directories
  - /var/run : data relevant to running processes
  - /var/tmp : temporary files preserved between reboots
